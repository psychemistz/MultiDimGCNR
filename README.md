# Generalized Multidimensional Distribution overlap Metric (GMDM)
GMDM: A generalized multi-dimensional distribution overlap metric for data and model quality evaluation

## Abstract 
In this article, we design and analyze a **generalized multi-dimensional distribution overlap metric** (GMDM) as a generic tool for quantifying similarity or difference between two multivariate distributions for the evaluation of data and model quality. Our experiments on different real-world datasets substantiate that the proposed metric is an apposite intuitive alternative for quantification of the performance of training models and the consistency of multiple datasets. The proposed metric is suitable, for example, for quality assessment of unsupervised training models trained using unpaired data, image denoising models, feature embedding in protein sequence classification, and the estimation of class-specific consistency in datasets of variable dimensions such as the MNIST, ORL, and CIFAR. Our study indicates a good agreement of the GMDM with conventional image quality and performance metrics.
